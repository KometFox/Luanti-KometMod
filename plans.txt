Version 1.0 Release

Mod name: TODO

Description of Mod: Introduces various new elements, custom crafting tables, infinite source of ores, new elements. New firearms

All that without changing the Worldgen. 


1. Describe a Activity or Emotion you want for the player to feel:
-The player should have fun exploring the mod's content and utilizing it. The player should feel something
he has more content to play with which are useful in a specific case or usable as a generic utility item/block,
for example having access to a vast amount of orethyst should give the player more freedom in creating items and
removing the chore of mining blocks. 

Other examples are adding firearms which are easy to use, the firearms in this mod should have a somewhat realistic
approach to creating items such as gun powder but still not to the point it takes ages to have enough amount of it 
to use the weapons more. 

2. How to encourage this Activity and Emotion more.
-The player shouldn't feel burdened or burned out from using content because it is way too grindy to get it, 
he should feel he has more tools and weapons at his disposable which makes his gameplay more fun. There should 
be ideally enough content for the player to toy with but none of the content feeling too redundant, with the 
exceptions of firearms as there should be a variety of items so that the player has the freedom to choose his own
loadout. 


Additional Notes:
How to achieve it: 
-Avoid progression system that makes things too grindy or boring
-Avoid crafting system that are too hard to understand
-Avoid blocks system that are too complex too use

Notes on immersive crafting:
There will be a system which makes the crafting more plausible looking but it is done as a way to make the
crafting system more fun to play around with, this can be achieved by making sure it is not done in a way
which adds too much chores.
